        <p>This is a family favorite.  My aunt used to make them every Easter. The recipe comes from an old church cookbook. Whenever I order the meat from the meat market, I order ground ham and pork from a local meat market premixed. I order triple the meat required, packaged into three packages, give one to my mother, use one, and freeze one to use later. Serve these with horseradish.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
        <p><strong>step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Combine ground ham and pork in a bowl; stir in cracker crumbs, milk, and eggs. Shape mixture into 14 small oval loaves. Place loaves into prepared baking dish.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Mix brown sugar, cider vinegar, water, and dry mustard in a bowl, stirring until brown sugar has dissolved. Pour mixture over ham loaves.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; flip and bake until juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 more minutes.</p>
