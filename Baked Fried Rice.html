        <p>This easy oven method for baked "fried" rice produces something very similar to classic fried rice, but you don't need leftover rice to make it. Just like rice pilaf, the grains of rice get coated in fat before absorbing the cooking liquid, ensuring plump, tender, separate grains with no sticky clumps. If using a different kind of rice or pan size, just adjust the cooking time. Garnish with green onions and serve with a runny poached egg on top if desired.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Place rice in an 8x12-inch baking dish. Drizzle in canola and sesame oils, then toss rice until completely coated. Add ham, green onions, bell peppers, carrots, peas, garlic, and salt. Stir until well combined.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Bring chicken broth, soy sauce, and chile paste to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Pour broth over rice and stir briefly. Cover the baking dish tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 32 minutes. Remove and let stand for 10 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Carefully remove the foil and fluff rice with a fork. Taste and adjust seasoning. Return to the oven and cook until rice is browned and crusty on top, about 10 minutes.</p>
